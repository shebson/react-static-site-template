        <p>This is a simple template static sites / single page apps based on create-react-app. The
        site is written as a standard react app which is snapshotted to static html and
        uploaded to S3, with some niceties like stripping <code>.html</code> extensions. The project uses
        react-router and uses helmet to set title and other head tags.</p>
        <p>This project comes with a highly oppinionated linter, and makes a number of decisions that
        have been helpful in my personal projects, but may not be right for every project.</p>
        <p>To get started, just do <code>yarn start</code></p>.
